Live settings
=============

Many of the configuration settings in askbot are accessible
to the site administators via link "settings" in the site header.

Any change to the "live settings" will be reflected on the site
immediately.

No-one but the site administrators can change those settings.

.. note::
    Any user can be turned into an administrator via running a command.

        python manage.py add_admin <user_id>

    At the moment this command is not available from the web-interface
    but this will be fixed in the future.
